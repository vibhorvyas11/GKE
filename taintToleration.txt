1) Add taint to the worker nodes 
kubectl taint node worker1 qwerty=abcxyz:NoSchedule

2) Create a deployment with taint 
#vim dp.yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dp1
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
      containers:
      - name: cont1
        image: nginx:1.14.2
~                               

3) Deploy the deployment
#kubectl create -f dp.yml
# kubectl get pods -o wide 
you will be able to see the pods are deployed on worker2 

4) add the toleration in deployment defination 
# kubectl delete deployment dp1 
# vim dp.yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dp1
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      tolerations:
        - key: qwerty
          operator: Equal
          value: abcxyz
          effect: NoSchedule

      containers:
      - name: cont1
        image: nginx:1.14.2


5) Create the deployment and verify 
# kubectl create -f dp.yml
# kubectl get pods -o wide 
You should be able to see pods getting deployed on both the worker node 


6) To remove the taint from the node 
# kubectl taint node worker1 qwerty-
